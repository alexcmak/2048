# 2048 Game

A simple Python implemenation of the classic card 2048.
This game is based on [another implementation](https://github.com/DBgirl/PyGames/blob/main/5_2048/2048.py).

## Requirements

You will need **Python 3** and **pygame**

Please read more about [how to install](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) pygame.

**pip** can be tricky to run, pygame can be tricky to install. This may help you:

`pip install pygame --pre`

To run this game once you have python and pygame, run something like this in the command line:

`python 2048.py`

## Features

This game can be configured to be any square, not just the usual 4 x 4.
You can also set the game to be easier if you wish to end the game with a number less than 2048
